# 🎫 EventPass

**A Real-World College Event Ticketing & Entry Management System**

---

## Problem Statement

Managing college events — fests, workshops, hackathons — is a pain. Most colleges still rely on Google Forms and WhatsApp groups to handle registrations. This leads to:

- **Overbooking** — No way to enforce seat limits in real time, so events get overbooked.
- **Fake entries** — Anyone can forward a registration link or guess a ticket number.
- **No attendance tracking** — Organizers have no reliable way to verify who actually showed up.

EventPass is built to fix this.

## What is EventPass?

EventPass is a full-stack web application that handles the entire lifecycle of a college event — from creation to registration to entry verification.

There are two types of users:

### 🎓 Students
- Browse upcoming events on a live feed.
- Register for an event with a single click.
- Get a unique **Ticket ID (UUID)** generated by the server — this is their digital pass.
- View their registered events and ticket history.

### 🛠️ Organizers
- Create events with a title, description, date, venue, and a **maximum seat capacity**.
- Track how many people have registered vs. how many seats are left.
- Use a **Check-in Portal**: enter a student's Ticket UUID to verify if it's valid and mark them as "Attended."

## Core Features

### 1. Capacity Guard
Before every registration, the backend checks how many seats are already taken. If the event is full, the registration is rejected with a clear error. No overbooking, period.

### 2. Secure Ticket Generation
Each registration produces a **UUID-based ticket** that's impossible to guess. No sequential IDs, no patterns — just a random, unique string tied to that specific student and event.

### 3. Role-Based Access Control
The system enforces roles at the API level:
- Students can browse and register.
- Only Organizers can create events and access the check-in portal.
- Routes are protected by authentication middleware.

### 4. Check-in Verification
At the event entrance, organizers paste a Ticket UUID into the check-in portal. The system verifies:
- Is this a real ticket?
- Is it for *this* event?
- Has this person already checked in?

### 5. Event Lifecycle
Events have a status — `UPCOMING`, `ONGOING`, `COMPLETED`, or `CANCELLED`. Registration is only allowed for `UPCOMING` events. Organizers can update the status as the event progresses.

| Layer | Technology |

| ORM | Prisma |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Frontend | React.js |
| Auth | JWT (JSON Web Tokens) |

## Architecture

The backend follows a **Controller → Service → Repository** pattern:

- **Controllers** handle incoming HTTP requests and send responses.
- **Services** contain the business logic — checking capacity, validating tickets, enforcing roles.
- **Repositories** talk to the database through Prisma. No raw SQL leaks into the business layer.

The codebase uses **OOP principles** in TypeScript:
- **Inheritance** — A base `User` class extended by `Student` and `Organizer`.
- **Encapsulation** — Database logic is hidden behind Repository classes.
- **Polymorphism** — Event behavior changes based on its status.
- **Abstraction** — Interfaces define contracts between layers.
